README = "This is the gem5 simulator.\n\nThe main website can be found at http://www.gem5.org\n\nA good starting point is http://www.gem5.org/Introduction, and for\nmore information about building the simulator and getting started\nplease see http://www.gem5.org/Documentation and\nhttp://www.gem5.org/Tutorials.\n\nTo build gem5, you will need the following software: g++ or clang,\nPython (gem5 links in the Python interpreter), SCons, SWIG, zlib, m4,\nand lastly protobuf if you want trace capture and playback\nsupport. Please see http://www.gem5.org/Dependencies for more details\nconcerning the minimum versions of the aforementioned tools.\n\nOnce you have all dependencies resolved, type 'scons\nbuild/<ARCH>/gem5.opt' where ARCH is one of ALPHA, ARM, NULL, MIPS,\nPOWER, SPARC, or X86. This will build an optimized version of the gem5\nbinary (gem5.opt) for the the specified architecture. See\nhttp://www.gem5.org/Build_System for more details and options.\n\nWith the simulator built, have a look at\nhttp://www.gem5.org/Running_gem5 for more information on how to use\ngem5.\n\nThe basic source release includes these subdirectories:\n   - configs: example simulation configuration scripts\n   - ext: less-common external packages needed to build gem5\n   - src: source code of the gem5 simulator\n   - system: source for some optional system software for simulated systems\n   - tests: regression tests\n   - util: useful utility programs and files\n\nTo run full-system simulations, you will need compiled system firmware\n(console and PALcode for Alpha), kernel binaries and one or more disk\nimages. Please see the gem5 download page for these items at\nhttp://www.gem5.org/Download\n\nIf you have questions, please send mail to gem5-users@gem5.org\n\nEnjoy using gem5 and please share your modifications and extensions.\n"
