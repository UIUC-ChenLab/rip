/**
 * Model of an ARM PMU version 3
 *
 * This class implements a subset of the ARM PMU v3 specification as
 * described in the ARMv8 reference manual. It supports most of the
 * features of the PMU, however the following features are known to be
 * missing:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Event filtering (e.g., from different privilege levels).
 *   <li>Access controls (the PMU currently ignores the execution level).
 *   <li>The chain counter (event no. 0x1E) is unimplemented.
 * </ul>
 *
 * The PMU itself does not implement any events, in merely provides an
 * interface for the configuration scripts to hook up probes that
 * drive events. Configuration scripts should call addEventProbe() to
 * configure custom events or high-level methods to configure
 * architected events. The Python implementation of addEventProbe()
 * automatically delays event type registration until after
 * instantiation.
 *
 * In order to support CPU switching and some combined counters (e.g.,
 * memory references synthesized from loads and stores), the PMU
 * allows multiple probes per event type. When creating a system that
 * switches between CPU models that share the same PMU, PMU events for
 * all of the CPU models can be registered with the PMU.
 *
 * @see The ARM Architecture Refererence Manual (DDI 0487A)
