/**
 * In-kernel GIC model.
 *
 * When using a KVM-based CPU model, it is possible to offload GIC
 * emulation to the kernel. This reduces some overheads when the guest
 * accesses the GIC and makes it possible to use in-kernel
 * architected/generic timer emulation.
 *
 * This device uses interfaces with the kernel GicV2 model that is
 * documented in Documentation/virtual/kvm/devices/arm-vgic.txt in the
 * Linux kernel sources.
 *
 * This GIC model has the following known limitations:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Checkpointing is not supported.
 *   <li>This model only works with kvm. Simulated CPUs are not
 *       supported since this would require the kernel to inject
 *       interrupt into the simulated CPU.
 * </ul>
 *
 * @warn This GIC model cannot be used with simulated CPUs!
