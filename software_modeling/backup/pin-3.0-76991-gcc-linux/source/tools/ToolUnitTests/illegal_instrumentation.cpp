/*! @file
 * This test tool verifies that PIN asserts that trace re-generation is equal
 * to the original trace generation.
 * When PIN generates a trace in the code cache, it does not generate the 
 * meta-data for that trace (App instructions vs. instrumentation code vs. spill/fill code). 
 * This meta-data is created only in case of an exception, when PIN needs to figure out what 
 * code caused the exception, by re-generating the trace. If the instrumentation scheme changes 
 * between the first and second trace generation, the results of the exception analysis are bogus.
