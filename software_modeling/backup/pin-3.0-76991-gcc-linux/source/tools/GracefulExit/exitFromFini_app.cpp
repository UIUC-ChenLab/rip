/*
 * This application tests for correctness when a tool calls PIN_ExitApplication/PIN_ExitProcess from within a thread-fini
 * or application-fini callback.
 * The following scenarios are tested:
 * 	1.  Call PIN_ExitApplication from the thread-fini callback of a thread executing its own thread-fini. We expect the
 * 	    test to fail with the error: "It is prohibited to call PIN_ExitApplication() from a thread-fini function".
 * 	2.  Call PIN_ExitApplication from the thread fini callback of a thread in a blocking system call. On Windows the
 * 	    thread-fini callback will be executed by a different OS thread than the one being terminated. We expect the test
 *      to fail with the same error as in scenario #1.
 *  3.  Call PIN_ExitApplication from an application-fini callback. We expect the test to fail with the error:
 *      "It is prohibited to call PIN_ExitApplication() from an application-fini function".
 *  4.  Call PIN_ExitProcess from the thread-fini callback of a thread executing its own thread-fini. We expect the test
 *      to pass.
 *  5.  Call PIN_ExitProcess from the thread-fini callback of a thread in a blocking system call. On Windows the
 *      thread-fini callback will be given by a different OS thread than the one exiting. We expect the test to pass.
 *  6.  Call PIN_ExitProcess from an application-fini callback. We expect the test to pass.
