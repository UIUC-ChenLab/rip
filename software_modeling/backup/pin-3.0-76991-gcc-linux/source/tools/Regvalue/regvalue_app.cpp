// ChangeRegsWrapper saves the registers that are about to be changed.
// Then it calls ChangeRegs. The tool intercepts this call and replaces

// The wrapper then calls SaveRegsToMem which stores the tool-modified
// values to memory and allows the tool to verify them.
// Finally, the original register values are restored.

// These values will be set in the SaveRegsToMem() function (see the changeRegs_<arch> assembly file).
