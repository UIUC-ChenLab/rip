# void ChangeRegsWrapper();
# This wrapper saves and restores the registers used by ChangeRegs.
# This is done in the wrapper since we want ChangeRegs to actually
# change the register values but not to affect the application itself.
# The tool may intercept ChangeRegs and replace it with its own function.
#
# Register usage:
# eax   - used (implicitly) by xsave
# ebx   - used for testing the gpr values
# ecx   - used for holding a pointer to the fp save area (used by fxsave)
# edx   - used (implicitly) by xsave
# st0   - used (implicitly) for loading a value to the FPU stack
# st2   - used for testing the FPU values
# xmm0  - used for testing the sse values
# ymm1  - used for testing the avx values
